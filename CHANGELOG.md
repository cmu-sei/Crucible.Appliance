Alloy - One event connected to a Player View, Caster Directory, and Steamfitter Scenario.

Caster - One Project that deploys a single Ubuntu VM and Distributed Portgroup.

- Requirements:
  1. vSphere server with a datacenter, cluster and distributed virtual switch.
  2. Ubuntu Template or VM with a snapshot taken.
- Within caster make sure to customize `variables.auto.tfvars` file with your environment information.

Steamfitter - One scenario template with 4 simple tasks configured.

### VSPHERE_CLUSTER and STACK_CLUSTER_MOID variables added to the `env` file

- Steamfitter api requires the vSphere cluster MOID as a parameter.
